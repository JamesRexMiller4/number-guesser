# number-guesser
Paired Project 1908 FE - James Miller and Veronica Andrade 
### Project Summary  ###
***
The overview was to build a game where two users can guess a number between 1 and 100, with the ability to set ranges, 
if they desired, to increase the difficulty of the game. This game would generate a random number and the players would 
input their guess. The game would analyze the guesses and evaluate if they were too high or too low. If there were a winner,
then, the game would declare a winner and place a winner card with the player's info. This game required us to use HTML, CSS,
and Java Script for it to function as it does.

| Parent node | A node which has another node inside it.|
| Child node  | A node  _directly_  inside another node. |
| Function | A predefined and reusable group of behavior. |
| Call/Invoke | Running a function. |
|  Parameters | The variables declared in a function definition. |
| Arguments | The variables passed to a function when itâ€™s called/invoked. |	
| HTML Element | A building block that makes up the structure of a web page. |
|CSS Selector |  A way to identify a set elements, typically using a tag, class or id.|
| Interface |  a shared boundary across which two separate components exchange information.|
| DOM | Document Object Model, the JS interface used to interact with HTML |

| Ternary |The **conditional (ternary) operator** is the only JavaScript operator that takes three operands. This operator is frequently used as a shortcut for the [`if`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/if...else) statement.||

#### 	Objectives and Professional Development
+ Colaborate together on ideas to expand professional knowlege and training in HTML, CSS, and Java Script. 
+  Increase work preformance by carefully analyzing syntax errors to avoid merge conflicts and data errors.
+   Develop your skills in writing:
    -   semantic HTML
    -   clean & organized CSS styles
    -   DRY and organized JavaScript
+   Manipulate the page after it has loaded adding, removing, and updating elements on the DOM
+   Understand event bubbling and use event delegation on dynamic elements
+ Git workflow

#### Examples:
In this example, we took the `if else` statements out but replacing `if`, at the beginning of the condition, and placing a `?` at the end of the condition.  After the conditon was set, we placed statements in before and after the   `:` acting as the `else` in the condition.
```
(grabName1.length ==  0  && grabName2.length ==  0  &&
 grabGuess1.value ==  0  && grabGuess2.value ==  0) ?
(resetbtn.disabled =  true) : (resetbtn.disabled =  false) 
```

Here, we added a simple function to grab our users input from the `inputField` which would normally return as a `string` , but we added `parseInt` so that it would take the string and return an Integer.
```
function changeToInt(inputField) {
return parseInt(inputField.value);
} 
```
